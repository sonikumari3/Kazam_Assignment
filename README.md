What is MQTT Protocol?

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a messaging protocol for restricted low-bandwidth networks and extremely high-latency IoT devices. Since Message Queuing Telemetry Transport is specialized for low-bandwidth, high-latency environments, it is an ideal protocol for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.

What is WebSockets?

As per the conventional definition, WebSocket is a duplex protocol used mainly in the client-server communication channel. It’s bidirectional in nature which means communication happens to and fro between client-server. 

The connection, developed using the WebSocket, lasts as long as any of the participating parties lays it off. Once one party breaks the connection, the second party won’t be able to communicate as the connection breaks automatically at its front.

WebSocket need support from HTTP to initiate the connection. Speaking of its utility, it’s the spine for modern web application development when seamless streaming of data and assorted unsynchronized traffic is concerned.
